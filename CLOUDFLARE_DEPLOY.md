# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide

## Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED

**Last Deploy Attempt:** 2025-09-19 02:25:03
**Status:** Ready for deployment - all encoding issues resolved
**Solution:** Added explicit `encoding: utf-8` configuration to Jekyll

## Environment Details
- **Cloudflare Build System:** v3 (beta)
- **Ruby Version:** 3.4.4 (detected from error logs)
- **Build Command:** `bundle exec jekyll build`
- **Output Directory:** `_site`

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### ✅ RESOLVED: html-proofer nokogiri compilation
- **Problem:** html-proofer requires nokogiri which fails to compile
- **Solution:** Moved html-proofer to `:test` group in Gemfile
- **Status:** Fixed in commit `be23b57`

### ✅ RESOLVED: Jekyll Ruby compatibility
- **Problem:** Jekyll 4.1.1 not compatible with Ruby 3.4+
- **Solution:** Upgraded to Jekyll 4.3.4
- **Status:** Fixed in commit `6cf2355`

### ✅ RESOLVED: Missing stdlib gems in Ruby 3.4+
- **Problem:** Ruby 3.4+ moved gems from default to bundled gems
- **Solution:** Added all commonly needed gems from Ruby 3.4+ bundled gems list
- **Status:** Fixed - all gems added and tested locally

### ✅ RESOLVED: Jekyll encoding error
- **Problem:** `Encoding::UndefinedConversionError` - Jekyll treating files as ASCII-8BIT instead of UTF-8
- **Solution:** Added explicit `encoding: utf-8` configuration to `_config.yml`
- **Status:** Fixed - Jekyll build completes successfully with proper UTF-8 encoding

## Ruby 3.4+ Bundled Gems Added
- `csv` ✅ (was causing LoadError)
- `base64` ✅ (commonly needed by Jekyll/deps)
- `bigdecimal` ✅ (commonly needed)
- `mutex_m` ✅ (threading/concurrency)
- `drb` ✅ (distributed Ruby)
- `observer` ✅ (observer pattern)

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT READY
All major issues have been systematically resolved:
1. ✅ **Ruby 3.4+ compatibility** - All bundled gems added
2. ✅ **Jekyll compatibility** - Upgraded to 4.3.4
3. ✅ **Encoding issues** - UTF-8 configuration added
4. ✅ **Local testing** - Jekyll build completes successfully
